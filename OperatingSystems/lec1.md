# Operating Systems

- Provide consistent abstractions to applications, even on different hardware
- Manage sharing of resources among multiple applications

***The key building blocks:***
- Processes
- Threads, Concurrency, Scheduling, Coordination
- Address Spaces
- Protection, Isolation, Sharing, Security
- Communication, Protocols
- Persistent storage, transactions, consistency, resilience
- Interfaces to all devices

## What does an operating systems does?
***Most Likely:*** 
- Memory Management 
- I/O Management
- CPU Scheduling 
- Communications? (Does Email belong in OS?) 
- Multitasking/multiprogramming ?
