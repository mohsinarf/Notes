# Radar vs Utrasonic Sensors

| Feature                 | Ultrasonic Sensor                                         | Radar Sensor                                               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Operating Principle** | Uses sound waves to detect objects                        | Uses radio waves to detect objects                         |
| **Range**               | Typically short range (up to a few meters)                | Longer range (up to hundreds of meters)                    |
| **Accuracy**            | Moderate, affected by environmental factors               | High, less affected by environmental conditions            |
| **Environmental Impact**| Affected by temperature, humidity, and wind               | Less impacted by environmental factors                     |
| **Detection Capability**| Works well with solid, large, and smooth surfaces         | Works well with various materials, including rough and small objects |
| **Speed of Measurement**| Slower response time due to sound wave travel             | Faster response time due to speed of radio waves           |
| **Interference**        | Prone to interference from other ultrasonic devices       | Less prone to interference, but can interfere with other radar systems |
| **Cost**                | Generally inexpensive                                     | Typically more expensive                                   |
| **Application Examples**| Proximity sensing in parking sensors, robotics            | Vehicle collision avoidance, long-range object detection   |
