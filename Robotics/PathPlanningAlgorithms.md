| Dijkstra's Algorithm     | Finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. | - Guarantees finding the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes. | - Does not work with negative edge weights.                           | O(V) + O(E)      | O((V + E) * log(V)) for binary heap |
