VTable?
In C++, a vtable (virtual table) is a mechanism used in object-oriented programming to implement dynamic dispatch, particularly for polymorphic behavior. It is a table of function pointers associated with a class hierarchy where each entry in the table points to the most derived function implementation for that method. Vtables are used to support runtime polymorphism through virtual functions.

Compilation Phase:

During compilation, the compiler creates a vtable for each class that has at least one virtual function.
The vtable is essentially an array of function pointers.
Each virtual function in the class corresponds to an entry in the vtable.
Construction of Objects:

When an object of a class with virtual functions is created, a hidden pointer called the vptr (virtual pointer) is added to the object.
This vptr points to the vtable of the class.
Function Calls:

When a virtual function is called through a base class pointer or reference, the compiler looks up the vptr of the object to determine the appropriate vtable.
It then uses the vtable to find the correct function pointer for the virtual function being called.
The function pointed to by the vtable entry is invoked.
Dynamic Dispatch:

This process is called dynamic dispatch because the actual function to be called is determined at runtime based on the type of the object, rather than at compile time.
This enables polymorphic behavior, where the correct function implementation is called based on the runtime type of the object.
Here's a more detailed example illustrating the steps:

```
#include <iostream>

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        std::cout << "Animal makes a sound" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "Dog barks" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* animalPtr;

    Dog dog;

    animalPtr = &dog;

    // Step 1: Object creation:
    // - Object of type Dog is created
    // - vptr is added to the object, pointing to Dog's vtable

    // Step 2: Function call through base class pointer:
    // - Compiler checks the vptr of the object pointed to by animalPtr
    // - It finds Dog's vtable
    // - It looks up the entry for makeSound() in Dog's vtable
    // - It calls the function pointed to by that entry, which is Dog::makeSound()
    animalPtr->makeSound(); // Output: "Dog barks"

    return 0;
}
```
Understanding vtables is crucial for leveraging the power of runtime polymorphism in C++.
