# EtherCat
Ethernet stands for ethernet for control and automation technology.
Both Ethernet and EtherCat work on the Physical and Data Link layer in OSI (open system interconnection) model.
Ethernet uses the request and send protocol. While EtherCAT uses a single frame that is passed through each node. The speed of EtherCat comes from processing on the fly.


## Issue with Ethernet
1) not good BandWidth utilization
2) Stack delays
3) Switch delays
