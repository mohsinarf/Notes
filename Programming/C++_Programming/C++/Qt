Here's a simplified overview of how event handling works in Qt:

Event Creation: Events are generated by the underlying operating system or by Qt itself. For example, when a user clicks a button, the operating system generates a mouse click event.

Event Posting: The generated events are posted to the event queue of the application. The event queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure that holds pending events.

Event Dispatch: The event loop retrieves events from the event queue one by one. It examines each event and determines which object should receive it based on the event's target.

Event Delivery: The event is delivered to the appropriate object. The object's event() function is called, passing the event as a parameter.

Event Processing: The object processes the event by performing the appropriate actions. For example, a button object might handle a mouse click event by emitting a clicked signal.

Signal-Slot Mechanism: If the event results in a signal being emitted, the signal is handled using the signals and slots mechanism in Qt. Connected slots are invoked, allowing other objects to respond to the event.

Event Propagation: After an object has processed the event, Qt determines whether the event should be further propagated to other objects. For example, if a button is inside a container widget, the container widget may also receive the event.

Event Deletion: Once an event has been processed and propagated, it is deleted from the event system.
